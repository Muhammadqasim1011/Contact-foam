# Simple Contact Form

This is a simple contact form built using HTML and CSS, designed to be easily integrated into websites. The form allows users to input their name, email address, and a message, which can then be submitted. Upon submission, the form data is sent to the specified API endpoint using the POST method. The API endpoint used here is provided by [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/), which facilitates form submissions and handling.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-contact-form.git



2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred code editor.

3. Customize the form if necessary. You can modify the placeholder text, add or remove input fields, or change the styling by editing the `video.css` file.

4. If you want to use a different API endpoint for form submission, update the `action` attribute in the `<form>` tag accordingly.

5. Once you're satisfied with the form, you can deploy it to your website. Simply upload the files to your web server or integrate them into your existing website structure.
